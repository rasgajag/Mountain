In the year 200BM (Before Mountain) there was a group of wizards who wanted to create a very powerful spell, one so that they could destroy their enemys with a flaming dragon. They miscalculated, their spell had not created fire in the shape of a dragon but a cloud, an exspanding cloud razing every city in its wake. There was a small group of exstreamly inteligent people from all the races of the world who in a combined effort  used their basic magic to mine away at the mountain sealing themselves in just as the fire started to aprouch.

The Mountain or now city called "Adva" (This is short for advancement)
